# SAFETYAPP
This is an application that will enable its users make informed decisions on routes to take while traveling to different destinations. The user will be required to input a starting point and the destination. The application will then give different routes and their safety score indexes. The safety score indexes are generated by users who have used the same route before and given a score depending on how safe they felt. The user then decides on the route to use. After reaching the destination, the user will be required to give a safety score index based on their experiences while using the path and reason for the score ie the route has no street lights etc
